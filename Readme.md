# JavaScript Projects

This repository used to hold all my JavaScript projects, back when I thought that Github only allows having 6 repositories per user; Now this repo is becoming a hub for all my JS-related projects.


#### Reddit Programmer Challenges

Redditors over [/r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) have created a collection of challenges for programmers on three different levels of experience. I won't just do any of them, but select carefully. :) [See the list](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/wiki/challenges)

- **Number Guessing Game**  
	[Code & Readme](https://github.com/EnslavedEagle/-JS-Guessing-Game) | [Demo](http://tth.patrykb.pl/NumberGuessingGame/) | [Reddit Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/pii6j/difficult_challenge_1/)  
	Simple game, which tries to guess the user's number.
- **To-Do List**  
	[Code & Readme](https://github.com/EnslavedEagle/-JS-ToDo-App) | [Reddit Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3a64hq/20150617_challenge_219_intermediate_todo_list/) | [Demo](http://tth.patrykb.pl/reddit-daily-programmer/001/)  
	Very simple To-Do list application. Because everybody has one.


#### Angular 2 projects

I fell in love with Angular 2 for its powerfulness and ease of use, and I would love to pursue mastering it. For now, I only have few projects I've started with it.

- **Tic-Tac-Toe game**  
	[Code & Readme](https://github.com/EnslavedEagle/-NG2-TicTacToe) | [Demo](http://tth.patrykb.pl/ng2-tictactoe/)  
	This game allows you to play a tic-tac-toe game against the bot, sitting on [314.tt](http://314.tt/)'s server. This was my recrutation assignment, which made a very good impression on the recriuitment team.
- **Radio App (WiP)**  
	[Code & Readme](https://github.com/EnslavedEagle/-NG2-RadioApp) | [Demo](http://tth.patrykb.pl/ng2-radio/)  
	The first "real" app I promised myself to finish someday. I already got myself a ShoutCast API Key, so I might start any day now. Currently it allows users to listen to 2 radiostations and see 1 error message on an inactive one.


The Number Guessing App's directory is in this repository to stay for a little longer, because I put a link to it in my CV, and I don't want to confuse people. It's going away someday, but not today.

#### There's still more to come.
